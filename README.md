MolModel - Josh Hummel

The end goal of this project is to develop software that can model compounds and predict their properties through the use of machine learning
and concepts from chemistry, physics, and materials science.

Roadmap:

[x] Complete physics engine of particles in Python
[x] Complete physics calculation in C
___ Simulate in 3D
___ Train ML model to recognize and predict properties of atoms
___ Complete physics engine of materials and objects
___ Train ML model to predict properties of compounds
